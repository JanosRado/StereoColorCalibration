# StereoColorCalibration
We present an optimization algorithm that provides the set of digital video values that achieve minimal cross-talk at user-defined average luminance and dot contrast for both eyes based on photometric characterisctics of a given display. The method can be easily used for anaglyphic and polar filter 3D systems.
